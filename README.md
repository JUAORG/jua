🔑 Core Enhancements

1. Knowledge Session Logs (per request)
Log events like "session started", "screen shared", or "file sent" to build trust & accountability.

2. Feedback + Rating System
After each session, allow both parties to leave:

    A rating (1–5 stars)

    Optional written feedback
    → This could be tied to provider reputation or visibility.

3. Profile Badging
Visual markers for milestones:

    “5+ Sessions Completed”

    “Highly Rated” (avg 4.5+)

    “Verified Expert” (admin flagged)

🧠 Learning-Oriented Features

4. Service Templates
Let providers define repeatable “knowledge packages” (e.g., "Intro to Photoshop – 30min").

5. Session Recording Consent + Upload
Option to record Jitsi calls (with consent) and attach to the request for later review (if privacy allows).

6. Session Prep Materials
Allow providers to attach optional resources (PDFs, links) before the session.
🤝 Social & Growth Features

7. Referral System
Let users refer others and earn credits for completed sessions.

8. Community Channel / Forum
Space to ask for help, showcase success stories, or request topics.

9. Open Requests Marketplace (optional)
Let customers post requests that providers can respond to (instead of only booking specific people).
